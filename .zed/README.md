## 🚨 CRITICAL RULES (ALWAYS ACTIVE)

### Validation Standards (NO EXCEPTIONS)

- **NO ERROR DEBT**: All builds must pass (`cargo build --release`, `cargo test --workspace`)
- **NO FAKE TIMESTAMPS**: Use real current UTC time only (call `now` tool)
- **NO FAKE COMPLETIONS**: All work must be genuinely complete
- **USE REAL DATA**: Never fabricate metrics, logs, or status information
- **HOOK VALIDATION**: All hooks must have functional tools (run `./tools/validate-hook-tools.sh`)

### Session Tracking (MANDATORY)

```bash
# Start immediately before any work:
./tools/ai-work-tracker.sh -Action start-session -AgentName "agent-name" -Objective "task"

# Update every 15-30 minutes:
./tools/ai-work-tracker.sh -Action update-session -Progress 75 -TokensUsed 500 -Context "status"

# Complete when done:
./tools/ai-work-tracker.sh -Action complete-session -Summary "accomplishments"
```

**FALLBACK**: If scripts fail, create manual files in `dev-works/sessions/ACTIVE-{timestamp}-{task}.md`

- **Session Tracking**: `dev-works/sessions/{STATUS}-{timestamp}-{task}.md`
- **Learning Data**: `.kiro/patterns/{pattern-type}.yaml` (Learning patterns)
- **Editor Integration**: `.rules` (Editor-specific AI-CORE bridge configuration)

### 🎯 Agent Spec Navigation Instructions

**ALWAYS scan `.kiro/specs/` for available specifications before starting any work.**

**Available Spec Directories:**

- `.kiro/specs/AI-PLATFORM/` - Core platform specifications
- `.kiro/specs/project-template/` - Standard project templates
- `.kiro/specs/launch-asap/` - Quick launch specifications
- `.kiro/specs/{project-name}/` - Project-specific specs

**Agent Instructions for Spec Usage:**

**spec-agent** - YOU MUST:

- Scan all spec directories first: `ls .kiro/specs/*/`
- Identify which specs are relevant to current task
- Reference multiple specs if needed (AI-PLATFORM + project-specific)
- Always check for `requirements.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md` in each spec folder

**architect-agent** - YOU MUST:

- Read `.kiro/specs/AI-PLATFORM/design.md` for platform architecture
- Check project-specific `design.md` for constraints
- Cross-reference multiple design documents for conflicts
- Ensure architecture aligns with ALL relevant specs

**pm-agent** - YOU MUST:

- Aggregate tasks from ALL relevant spec directories
- Priority: AI-PLATFORM specs > project-specific specs > templates
- Check for conflicting requirements across specs
- Track completion against multiple spec sources

**ALL AGENTS** - MANDATORY SPEC WORKFLOW:

1. `find .kiro/specs/ -name "*.md" | head -10` - Discover available specs
2. Identify which specs apply to your current task domain
3. Read relevant specs in priority order: requirements → design → tasks
4. Cross-reference for conflicts or dependencies
5. Document which specs you're following in your work output

### 🎯 Agent Steering Context Instructions

**STEERING = Mini context files for on-demand decision guidance**

**Available Steering Types:**

- `.kiro/steering/architecture-decision-template.md` - ADR template for major decisions
- `.kiro/steering/tech-stack.md` - Technology selection guidance
- `.kiro/steering/{domain}-context.md` - Domain-specific decision contexts
- `.kiro/steering/{agent}-guidelines.md` - Agent-specific steering rules

**steering-agent** - YOU MUST:

- Create mini context files for recurring decision patterns
- Use ADR format for architectural decisions
- Tag each steering file with relevant agents: `@architect @backend @security`
- Keep steering files focused: 1 decision topic per file
- Update steering files when patterns change

**ALL AGENTS** - STEERING WORKFLOW:

1. `find .kiro/steering/ -name "*.md" | grep -E "(decision|context|guidelines)"`
2. Select 1-3 most relevant steering files for current decision
3. Load steering context: `@.kiro/steering/{relevant-file}.md`
4. Follow steering guidance for consistent decisions
5. Create new steering file if decision pattern is new
6. Reference steering decisions in your work output

**Steering File Patterns:**

- **Decision Templates**: Use for repeatable architectural decisions
- **Context Guidelines**: Use for domain-specific constraints (security, performance)
- **Agent Guidelines**: Use for agent-specific decision rules
- **Tech Constraints**: Use for technology selection boundaries
